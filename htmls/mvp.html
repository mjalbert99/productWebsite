        <h2>MVP: Smart Auto Blinds</h2>
        <p>Smart auto blinds are a new designed system of blinds that use
        electro-polarizing film to act as a way to block or let in an
        automated or manually controlled way by the user. This system would
        allow a user to connect with their smartphones to the film allowing them
        to adjust the level of tint on the fly or set a specific level of light that
        should be allowed through the film at any time based on the current light levels
        of the outside environment.</p>

        <h1 class="week1"> Week 1: Basic Product Planning & Interview</h1>
        <p> In this week we started the basic layout of our product(seen below) where we discuss the market we want to enter,
        the mian customer base, the job we wish to do with our product, our sales approach, our design, and our monetization
        plan for the overall product. Additionally, we are ironing out the finer details and seeing if we need more revisions.
        Secondary we did customer interviews, where we each were supposed to interview a "potential" customer for our product
        and get a consensus for the end goal product and to adjust based on what we got back</p>
        <h2>Product Layout</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>
             <p>
              Persona: People who work are wanting a more advanced system to adjust the amount of natural
                 light that is allowed in through their windows. Customers who want to automate or be able to
                 control the natural light in a room by a push of a button instead of manually have to pull and
                 twist blind cords and rods to open or close their blinds.
             </p>
           </li>
            <li>
             <p>
                Job to be Done: Provide an automated system that will adjust electric polarized blinds remotely or by a
                 schedule, in order to allow a smart home experience for a user as well as bring to market a better system
                 then manual blinds to have a wider range of light level a user could choose over old-fashioned blinds
             </p>
           </li>
            <li>
             <p>
                Product Design: Variable electric polarized screen to replace traditional blinds. Can be used with app
                 where it can be manually set or scheduled to let in a certain amount of light
             </p>
           </li>

            <li>
             <p>
                Unique Value Proposition: Ease of use and smart use tech in a new setting. Allows a user to
                 adjust to any light level a window would let in( traditional blinds don't have wide range
                 but more of a on and off setting)
             </p>

                    Strategy compass â†’ Disruption, curtains still operate manually, and auto blinds are very expensive
                    and not as customizable as our brand will be. We plan to disrupt that market by providing an alternative
                    to the traditional and new tech in the field.

        <h1 class="week2"> Week 2: Writing the Project Format</h1>
        <p>
            Worked on the job stories for the MVP project expanding on our initial ideas of what as a customer we would
            want the product to work and how to interact with it. These went into basic functionality, app based interactions,
            IOT interactions, initial product setup and instructions, and how well the product would work. We also refined
            more of out initial MVP write-ups based on the instructor provided criticism. This involved refining a specific
            customer we are aiming to market to since before it was vague and did not seem to align with a marketable path
            that would help our product succeed. Additionally, we started to work on the slideshow for the MVP presentation
            my job is `Job Stories`, `Monetization`, and `Market Research`.
        </p>

        <h1 class="week3">Week 3: Final Revisions and Video</h1>
        <p>
            In this week we as a group finalized the MVP report. After each fo us did our individual parts. We got together
            in and went over the full document together as a group. Once that was finalized, we wrote a script for our MVP
            video. We decided who would do what parts ( I did the introduction). Then we went to an empty classroom and
            shot the video the same day. Afterwards it was edited and submitted.
